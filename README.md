# SQL-Challenge  
  
**Data Modeling**:     
  
Inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. For this I used quickdatabasediagrams.com - a free tool available online.

**Data Engineering**:  
  
Used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Did the following:
 
Specified the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

**Data Analysis**:
*Created the queries needed to answer the following questions:*

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
